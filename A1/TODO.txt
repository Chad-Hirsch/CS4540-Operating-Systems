1st Submition
- In readfile.c: Remove 'mainArray'! The three arrays you make in Source.c 
are all you need! The array 'towns' *must* be an array of pointers to the 
elements of the 'cities' array! 
DONE!

- In Source.c and interactive.c you do malloc correct sizes, but in readfile.c 
you are malloc()'ing for the wrong types/sizes! A string of 100 letters long is 
allocated with the expression 'malloc(sizeof(char) * 101)' NOT 'malloc(sizeof(char*) * 101)'. 
Although it does give you enough space (because pointers are larger than letters), it's still not right!
DONE!

2nd 
- In readfile.c: You're first while loop in the big while loop has a line where it mallocs another 100 pointers, 
(and assigns it to a pointer designed for pointing to a single city, which is already an issue), 
Then it --in the next line-- overrides that only reference to those 800 bytes, loosing that data forever. 
Why do you even have that line?
DONE!

- Some of your makefile rules are missing some dependencies,
- Everytime I run 'make', it keeps relinking. It should only relink when files change.
DONE!

3rd
- In readFile(): The only malloc should be for the 'town' field, because the cities structures 
should've been allocated in getArrs(). Please writeit so there isn't the 'townZipStruct' variable. 
The elements of the towns array should be refering to the elements in the cities array.
DONE!

4th 
- In readfile(): 'malloc(sizeof(strlen(cityName)+1))' is wrong, something shouldn't be 
there that is. This issue causes all of the allocations to only be 8 bytes long, regardless of string length.
DONE!

5th
- In your makefile: Don't write explict commands for your rules! Including the linking rule!
- This doesn't even build, because your makefile can been called "makefile.txt"
- In readFile(): You forgot a "+ 1" in your malloc call
- You don't free every memory allocation! (-5)
